Consider each of the proficiencies and keep notes on your top three strengths and top three areas for growth.

## Areas I'm solid in 
- Appropriate Autonomy

I have spent almost 2 years doing a Masters Degree in Biostatistics while not being able to ever talk to a teacher.
Not part time but 40 hours a week with maybe talking to someone 4 times?  So have had to basically tech myself advanced statistics 
with a very limited math back ground. 

- Curiosity
Sounds cool and I've studied far too long not to be considered curious.  Specifically Ive had to study nuke engineering (Navy), biochemistry, statistics.
Wouldnt have exactly done all that if I was just interested in being mindless and watching reality TV.

- Adaptability

I lived on a boat with a living space of about 6x2x1 of living space.  From there I lived in SE Asia and during my time I got to deal with 2 "revolutions"  generally bloodless but
in Bangkok there was some shooting and had to evacuate out for a couple days because folks started burning down buildings.  That was pretty crazy because I lived next to one political parties 
"news station"  that ended up getting bombed and my roommate almost got caught up in that.  He was literally in the McDonald's in front of the building and if he had left a few minutes later 
he would have been caught in the explosion. From there Ive had to move back to my super ignorant rural town.  So yeah change aint a huge problem for me  





## Areas I need to 
- Networking

Yeah so not super into meeting randoms and then trying to get them to do things for me.  Seems rather cheap and disingenuous so not too terribly 
motivated to get into that.


- Health and Safety

Need to get back into running.  Ended up ripping my adductor and that still aint healed.  Also lost 3 months because I got a hairline fracture in my foot 
from taking on too much too fast.  

- Speaking

Not a huge fan of of public speaking especially when it's over some forced nonsense
