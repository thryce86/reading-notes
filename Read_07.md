control structures they just mean if or loops....

function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;             // Function returns the product of a and b
}

so dont do 
fn1= function(x).......
like in every other language


Operator	Description
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation (ES2016)
/	Division
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement

js actually has increment and decrement operators 
which is nice 

let x = 10;
x += 5;    :)

let x = 5 + 5;
let y = "5" + 5;
let z = "Hello" + 5;

concat is done  explicitly yayyyyy you dont (at least not here ) have to convert 



Operator	Description
==	equal to
===	equal value and equal type
!=	not equal
!==	not equal value or not equal type
>	greater than
<	less than
>=	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to
?	ternary operator




|  not ||    but I dont know how it deals with array values 

Operator	Description	Example	Same as	Result	Decimal
&	AND	5 & 1	0101 & 0001	0001	 1
|	OR	5 | 1	0101 | 0001	0101	 5
~	NOT	~ 5	 ~0101	1010	 10
^	XOR	5 ^ 1	0101 ^ 0001	0100	 4
<<	left shift	5 << 1	0101 << 1	1010	 10
>>	right shift	5 >> 1	0101 >> 1	0010	  2
>>>	unsigned right shift	5 >>> 1	0101 >>> 1	0010	  2





Name	Shorthand operator	Meaning
Assignment	x = f()	x = f()
Addition assignment	x += f()	x = x + f()
Subtraction assignment	x -= f()	x = x - f()
Multiplication assignment	x *= f()	x = x * f()
Division assignment	x /= f()	x = x / f()
Remainder assignment	x %= f()	x = x % f()
Exponentiation assignment	x **= f()	x = x ** f()
Left shift assignment	x <<= f()	x = x << f()
Right shift assignment	x >>= f()	x = x >> f()
Unsigned right shift assignment	x >>>= f()	x = x >>> f()
Bitwise AND assignment	x &= f()	x = x & f()
Bitwise XOR assignment	x ^= f()	x = x ^ f()
Bitwise OR assignment	x |= f()	x = x | f()
Logical AND assignment	x &&= f()	x && (x = f())
Logical OR assignment	x ||= f()	x || (x = f())
Logical nullish assignment	x ??= f()	x ?? (x = f())




function myFunc(theObject) {
  theObject.make = 'Toyota';
}

var mycar = {make: 'Honda', model: 'Accord', year: 1998};
var x, y;

x = mycar.make; // x gets the value "Honda"
